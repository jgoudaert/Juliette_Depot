	abstract = {New York City is attempting to find a solution to an issue that many states and cities face: how to minimize air pollution so that it has fewer negative impacts on human health. Despite having the highest population in the United States ({US}), New York City typically has reasonably clean air. As the City and State of New York have worked to reduce emissions from local and regional sources, the air quality in New York City has improved during the past few decades. Despite these advancements, air pollution still poses a severe hazard to the health of everyone living in New York's environment. Various diseases including respiratory, circulatory, neurological, gastrointestinal, and urinary illnesses, which can be fatal, are intimately associated with air pollution. This review article will concentrate on how air pollution affects respiratory diseases such as asthma in children. In addition to analyzing the severe effects of air pollution on the vulnerable population, this review article will highlight the health repercussions of air pollution on New York City and its residents. furthermore, we argue for potential ideas and discoveries while also putting up a policy option to lower air pollution.},
